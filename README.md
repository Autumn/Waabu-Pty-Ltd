# Waabu Cloud Services

Archive of the MVP I wrote for Waabu Cloud Services. 

- web servers written in Sinatra
- AngularJS frontend
- dashboard hooking into Xen for real time stats
- Ruby library and helper scripts for account management, payment processing and host provisioning

Too many issues to name, both with the code and the startup it was written for. I might do a post mortem one day...
